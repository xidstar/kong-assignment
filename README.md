## Getting Started

### Requirements
* Please make sure you have NodeJS installed, as this contains `npm`, which is necessary
for installing dependencies, starting the appropriate scripts, and building your web project.

### Local Setup
Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/xidstar/kong-assignment

Install all packages and dependencies required for this project:

    npm install
    
Start the development environment:

    npm start
 
Browser should navigate to: 

    http://localhost:8080/ 
    
Building files can be done as follows:

    npm run build


### Design Considerations

* The project uses the Bootstrap v4 library, therefore default bootstrap classes have been used in the implementation.

* The hero section breakpoint has moved up from the typical tablet(md) to desktop(lg) for better user experience. The text and hero-image look squished otherwise. 


### Assumptions
* A performance-optimized hosting solution will be used.


### Tradeoffs
